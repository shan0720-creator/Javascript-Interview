/* setTimeout is a built-in JavaScript function that allows you to schedule a function to be executed after a specified amount of time. The function accepts two arguments: the first argument is the function to be executed, and the second argument is the time in milliseconds after which the function should be executed.

Here are some key points about setTimeout:

The first argument to setTimeout can be a function or a string of code to be executed.
The second argument to setTimeout is the time in milliseconds after which the function should be executed.
If the second argument is 0, the function will be executed as soon as possible, but after the current script has finished executing.
If you need to pass arguments to the function being executed, you can do so by passing them as additional arguments after the time parameter.
setTimeout returns a timer ID, which can be used to cancel the execution of the function before it happens using the clearTimeout function.
If the function passed to setTimeout throws an error, the error will be caught and logged to the console, but it will not stop the execution of the remaining code.
If you need to execute a function repeatedly at a fixed interval, you can use the setInterval function instead of setTimeout. */

<!--setTimeout() will execute the process only once -->
<!--setInterval() keeps on executing the process-->
